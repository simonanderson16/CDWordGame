Make Game
- make it so each game has a start and end date
    - change date picker to range
    - update database to make document id reflect BOTH dates
    - update database to include start and end dates within document (useful for querying later)
- programatically control which tab user is on
- make summary boxes take you to corresponding tab when clicked
- look into OED or other dictionary API
